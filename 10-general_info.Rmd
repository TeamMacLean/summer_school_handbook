## Norwich and Norwich Research Park {-}

At the heart of East Anglia Norwich is a vibrant inviting city. Steeped in historic charm; The Cathedral, The Castle, the most complete medieval street pattern in the UK, the largest collection of pre-reformation churches in Northern Europe and the oldest hotel in the UK are all situated in Norwich. In medieval times Norwich was the second largest city in England. Norwich has the largest open-air market in England plus its own mustard “Colmans mustard” and Norwich City Football Club, The Canaries. In 2012 Norwich became a UNESCO city of literature. Norwich has a fantastic surrounding countryside including the Broads and Norfolk coast. 

The Norwich Research Park, with six independent partner institutions; UEA, The John Innes Centre, Earlham Institute, Quadram Institute, Norfolk and Norwich Hospital and The Sainsbury Laboratory. Norwich Research Park is ranked fourth in the UK for the number of internationally recognised scientists. UEA has the second highest graduate retention rate in the country with almost half of all graduates living and working locally.

## Excursion {-}

Sunday is a day of relaxation and we have booked a trip to the north Norfolk coastal town of Cromer. Perched on the very edge of the north Norfolk coast, Cromer is famous for its tasty crabs, wide open beaches, a traditional pier complete with a theatre providing seaside special variety shows and is awash with small local independent shops. The town offers a wide choice of restaurants and cafes with not a single coffee shop chain or national eating or drinking venue to be found. Instead you have cafes, bars and restaurants owned and operated by local residents all eager to serve both local residents and visiting guests. The bus will depart at 1100 am from John Innes Reception.

Later in the day, we have booked a boat in the nearby village of Morston to take us for a 1 hour trip out on Blakeney Point to see the population of seals that live there. The boat will leave at 16:45 and the bus will drop off at Morston from Cromer.

In recent years DNA sequencing has allowed genomes and transcriptomes of eukaryotic rusts and mildew pathogens to be studied. High-throughput imaging advances have made possible the study and visualisation of intracellular interactions during pathogenesis and defence. We will present and teach on these many aspects of plant-microbe interactions from the fundamental genomic, cellular and molecular processes to translational activities about how we convert basic discovery to real world impact. The TSL Summer School will focus on dynamic and interactive practical sessions will naturally promote strong interactions between speakers and participants. Over the next two weeks we will cover a wide range of topics, including: Pathogenomics Effectors Surface Immunity Bioinformatics Resistance Proteins Cellular Defence Proteomics Wheat Genomics Translation to the field We hope that you will find the whole exercise enlightening and educational and perhaps also a little fun.

Keynote Lecture Jijie Chai - Structural Study of Plant Receptor Kinases Max Planck Institute for Breeding Research, University of Cologne Plant receptor kinases (RKs) are a large family of single transmembrane proteins that play important roles in diverse biological processes including development, growth and immunity. RKs are characterized with diversified extracellular domains (ECDs) and conserved intracellular kinase domains. Recognition of their cognate ligands by ECDs of RKs initiates activation of RKs. The molecular mechanisms underlying this process remained poorly defined. We recently solved the crystal structures of the ECDs derived from several RKs in complex with their respective ligands. These structures define the molecular mechanisms by which these RKs recognize their specific ligands. More importantly, a general mechanism underlying ligand-induced activation of RKs can be formulated. In the current talk, I will briefly review what we have done on structural study of RKs and present two examples of how RK activation and ligand recognition mechanisms were used for the matching of receptor-ligand pairs. About Jijie Chai Jijie Chai was born on April 16, 1966 in Liaoning province, China. He received his bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering from Dalian Light Industry College, master’s degree in applied chemistry from the Research Institute of Petroleum Processing (Beijing) and Ph.D. in analytical chemistry from the Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College. From 1999 to 2004, he worked as postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University, where he started his research in structural biology. In July 2004, he joined the National Institute of Biological Sciences as an independent investigator, where he established his own research programs, structural study of plant receptor kinases and NOD-like receptors. After working there for six and half years, he moved to Tsinghua University and continued his research as a full professor. Early last year, he was awarded with the Alexander von Humboldt Professorship, and he moved to Cologne late March of 2017. Jijie has published a number of papers on RLKs and NLRs, advancing our understanding the mechanisms of RLK activation and NLR inhibition and activation. Jijie is happily married and the father of a daughter. He is currently living in Cologne. Practical Session - Model pathosystems and effector triggered immunity readouts Led by Zane Duxbury Aims and Objectives Become familiar with using model organisms to probe the plant immune system Understand and recognise the lifecycle and symptoms of some common diseases Understand transient expression systems for determining relationship between R and avirulence genes The plant immune system contains both cell surface and intracellular receptors. Cell surface receptors often confer broad spectrum recognition to conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and upon recognition the plant mounts an immune response termed PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). Pathogens co-evolve with their hosts and can overcome PTI through the evolution of proteins they secrete into plants, termed effectors, which suppress components of the PTI machinery. Plant intracellular receptors can detect effectors by binding them directly or by indirectly recognising their activity; this recognition triggers a strong immune response (effector-trigger immunity; ETI) that shares molecular components with PTI but is often stronger and is characterized by a cell-death response termed the hypersensitive response (HR). A recognised effector leads to loss of virulence in resistant plants with the cognate intracellular receptor, and is hence termed an avirulence factor (Avr) in this case. The intracellular receptors are encoded by Resistance (R) genes that have been strongly selected for by plant breeders for the strain-specific resistance conferred to pathogens that have broken other resistance mechanisms. This co-evolution of pathogen virulence versus plant immunity is encompassed by the zig-zag model of plant immunity (Figure 2 ) Figure 2: The zig-zag model of plant immunity (Jones and Dangl 2006). The ultimate amplitude of defence is the combined sum of resistance output (ETI+PTI) and the difference of the effect of pathogen effectors (-ETS; effector triggered susceptibility). This diagram captures the observation that many PTI and ETI outputs are similar, but HR is associated specifically with successful ETI, and that virulent pathogens with specific effectors are able to suppress immunity to compromise immunity. Image is from Pumplin and Voinnet (2013). The aim of this practical session will be to familiarise you with the use of model organisms to probe the plant immune system. The practical will include a general introduction to the oomycete pathogens of Arabidopsis: Albugo spp and Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (white rust and downy mildew respectively), the bacterial species Pseudomonas syringae and P. fluorescens, and the pathosystem of potato and the oomycete Phytophthora infestans (late blight) (Figure 3). We will familiarise you with the life cycle, pathogenesis and symptoms of these pathogens. We will use various techniques to assess the growth of pathogens on their hosts and to assess immune responses mounted against these pathogens. For example, we will use light microscopy of trypan-blue stained Arabidopsis infected with downy mildew to qualitatively assess the success of infection and resistance of different genotypes of the pathogen and plant. We will introduce transient expression systems such as bombardment and Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated Nicotiana tabacum transformation (agroinfiltration) to determine the relationship between R- and avirulence-genes responsible for compatible (resulting in disease) or incompatible (resulting in healthy plants) interactions.

Keynote Lecture Practical Session - From Sequence Data to Candidate Protein", " Genomic Resources and Bioinformatics for Plant Microbe Interactions. Led by Dan MacLean The increase in the generation and analysis of sequence data in the last ten years has had a profound effect on plant and microbe interaction research. The genomes of the wide range of host and pathogen’s of interest are now open to study in a way that is within reach of most scientists - not just large genome sequencing institutes - and many laboratories are now undertaking genomics as a routine approach. The deluge of data created by new sequencing approaches has been collected into a wide range of general and domain specific databases, each of which contain different information accessed in different ways. Knowing which are the most useful databases in a given context is therefore a tricky question and in this session we will take a tour of the most widely-used including Ensembl, PhytoPath, SolGenomics, TAIR and AraPort. Sequence data are used in a wide range of applications and the source molecule will be selected in an application specific way. Genomic DNA is used for assembly of draft genomes, RNA is used for gene expression analysis, genome annotation and exome construction. Both DNA and RNA get used to identify genetic polymorphisms. Mixed populations of nucleic acids from environmental (e.g soil or pathogen/host interaction sites) are used to study species compositions. A wide range of bioinformatics tools have been developed and are in common use for these approaches, so in this topic we will study briefly the tools and their core algorithms and competencies with the aim of helping you to decide on the right tools for any particular analysis that you may wish to do outside of the course. A useful guide is available in D. MacLean, Jones, and Studholme (2009). In particular we will look at algorithms and tools for de novo assembly of sequence including SOAPdenovo (Luo et al. 2012) and Celera Assembler. We will study tools for RNASeq expression and annotation analyses including Tophat (Trapnell, Pachter, and Salzberg 2009) and Bowtie (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) and DESeq (Anders and Huber 2010) and edgeR (Robinson, McCarthy, and Smyth 2010). Figure 4: Graphical summary of a de novo assembly algorithm. Sequence reads are broken down into constituent k-mers and a network of overlapping k-mers is produced. The paths in the graph are traversed and the k-mers collected into a growing string representing a long sequence in the original data and therefore genome. Keynote Lecture Diane Saunders - Field Pathogenomics John Innes Centre, Norwich, UK About Diane Saunders bio bio bio Practical Session - From Sequence Data to Candidate Protein Led by Dan MacLean Aims and Objectives Understand Strengths and Weaknesses of High Throughput Sequence Data Know how to call SNPs from HTS data on Categorise SNPs according to an expected genetic background Genomics has come a long way. We can now sequence genomes quickly and to a reasonable degree of accuracy. We can create in a high-throughput manner an inventory of sub-regions in a genome that we think are genes. We know the functions (or some of the functions) of lots of genes and we can infer functions of newly discovered genes by comparison of sequence or structure, basically by seeing whether our new thing looks like something else. These methods are actually only PREDICTIONS of function. Looking a bit like something else is only a clue to what something does. It frequently fails us. In this practical we will look at the powerful technique of mutational genomics. This is possibly the coolest thing ever as it involves mutating a living organism so that it is different from other things and then sequencing the genome to pinpoint the exact changes that cause the difference. We don’t have the scope or chemicals to do the mutation bit, so we’ll pick up with the genomics and use Galaxy and Galaxy tools to carry out the analysis that takes us from sequence data to actual candidate mutations in the genome sequence. With mutational genomics we deal initially with the effect of the gene on the whole organism. By performing mutagenesis on our favourite organism then carrying out a genetic screen (Page and Grossniklaus 2002) that selects individuals that have changed in the phenotype we are interested in, we have our first foothold on function. We can study those individuals and apply the principles of genetics, use modern high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics tools to identify the gene causing that phenotype change (or at least ones involved in the process we have messed up). We will use tools in the Galaxy (Goecks et al. 2010) framework including FastQC for quality control of sequence data (Figure 5) (Andrews 2017), BWA for read mapping and alignment (H. Li and Durbin 2009) and CandiSNP (Etherington et al. 2014) to identify candidate mutations (Figure 6) .

Keynote Lecture Keynote Speaker Name - Keynote Speaker Title Keynote Speaker Affiliation About Keynote Speaker bio bio bio Practical Session - Practical Session Title Led by Matt Moscou Aims and Objectives Understand different methods for resistance loci Introduce basic R packages for QTL analysis Understand how to link genotype (genetic maps) with phenotype (continuous/discrete measurements) with packages. Mendelian inheritance of resistance to plant pathogens was first established by Sir Roland Henry Biffen in 1907. By the end of the 20th century, the link of phenotype and genotype was established by map-based cloning of plant resistance genes to a range of plant pathogens. Although substantial advances have been made in cloning resistance genes from model species with small genomes, technical hurdles still exist for large complex genomes that may have little or no sequence information. This practical will consist of a general introduction of the different methodologies and approaches for identifying loci contributing to resistance in complex uncharacterized genomes and a tutorial on using R/qtl to link genotype (genetic maps) with phenotype (both quantitative and qualitative data).

Norwich and Norwich Research Park At the heart of East Anglia Norwich is a vibrant inviting city. Steeped in historic charm; The Cathedral, The Castle, the most complete medieval street pattern in the UK, the largest collection of pre-reformation churches in Northern Europe and the oldest hotel in the UK are all situated in Norwich. In medieval times Norwich was the second largest city in England. Norwich has the largest open-air market in England plus its own mustard “Colmans mustard” and Norwich City Football Club, The Canaries. In 2012 Norwich became a UNESCO city of literature. Norwich has a fantastic surrounding countryside including the Broads and Norfolk coast. The Norwich Research Park, with six independent partner institutions; UEA, The John Innes Centre, Earlham Institute, Quadram Institute, Norfolk and Norwich Hospital and The Sainsbury Laboratory. Norwich Research Park is ranked fourth in the UK for the number of internationally recognised scientists. UEA has the second highest graduate retention rate in the country with almost half of all graduates living and working locally. Wifi Connections Wifi is available throughout the site. If you have EDUROAM available, please use that. If you don’t have EDUROAM, you can get guest wireless passes from The John Innes Centre Reception. Social Media Tweeting and other social media activity are encouraged. #tslsummerschool, @TheSainsburyLab Map A live Google Map with useful sites marked is available here A static version is presented below. Excursion Sunday is a day of relaxation and we have booked a trip to the north Norfolk coastal town of Cromer. Perched on the very edge of the north Norfolk coast, Cromer is famous for its tasty crabs, wide open beaches, a traditional pier complete with a theatre providing seaside special variety shows and is awash with small local independent shops. The town offers a wide choice of restaurants and cafes with not a single coffee shop chain or national eating or drinking venue to be found. Instead you have cafes, bars and restaurants owned and operated by local residents all eager to serve both local residents and visiting guests. The bus will depart at 1100 am from John Innes Reception. Later in the day, we have booked a boat in the nearby village of Morston to take us for a 1 hour trip out on Blakeney Point to see the population of seals that live there. The boat will leave at 16:45 and the bus will drop off at Morston from Cromer. "]

# Surface Immunity {-}

**Led by Cyril Zipfel**

The first layer of plant innate immunity depends on the recognition of microbes via the perception of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) by plasma membrane-localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Plant PRRs are ligand-binding receptor kinases or receptor-like proteins that exist in multi-protein complexes to transduce intracellular immune signaling by triggering downstream phosphorylation cascades [@Couto:2016kq]. The Arabidopsis leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases (LRR-RKs) FLS2 and EFR are well-studied PRRs that bind the bacterial PAMPs flagellin and EF-Tu (or their immunogenic epitopes flg22 and elf18), respectively. In both cases, ligand-binding triggers rapid hetero-oligomerization with SERK co-receptors. Of these, BAK1/SERK3 and its closest paralog BKK1/SERK4 are the major regulators of FLS2- and EFR-dependent signaling. Intriguingly, BAK1 and other SERKs are also involved in various non-immune signaling pathways [@Ma:2016eu]. An allele of _BAK1_ specifically affected in PTI, _bak1-5_, enabled the uncoupling of BAK1’s functions in PTI, brassinosteroid (BR) signaling and cell death control [@Schwessinger:2011ku], allowing a detailed characterization of BAK1 in immune signaling without the influence of the morphological defects observed for other _BAK1_ alleles.

The plasma membrane-associated receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) BIK1 is an immediate convergent substrate of several different PRRs as well as BAK1 [@Couto:2016kq]. In response to PAMP perception, BIK1 is phosphorylated and released from the receptor complex and subsequently phosphorylates the NADPH oxidase RBOHD, which is required to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), one of the first hallmark responses triggered after PAMP perception [@Kadota:2014bi; @Li:2014dx]. Another early PTI response is the influx of apoplastic Ca<sup>2+</sup>via yet unknown channels, a response that is also BIK1-dependent [@Li:2014dx; @Ranf:2014fg; @Seybold:2014wt]. Subsequently, PAMP perception results in the activation of MAP kinase cascades and calcium-dependent protein kinases, which ultimately results in the transcriptional reprogramming of the cell mostly via WRKY transcription factors and ultimately to the restriction of pathogen growth [@Couto:2016kq]. Later responses associated with FLS2 and EFR activation include increased ethylene biosynthesis, callose deposition, and inhibition of seedling growth [@Boller:2009hu].

## Practical Session - Analysing Surface Immunity {-}

**Led by Martin Stegmann**

### Aims and Objectives {-}

1. Understanding of and hands on experience in classical methods to analyse PTI responses in the model organism _Arabidopsis thaliana_
2. Testing the importance of critical PTI regulators, mainly by analysing the impact of PRRs and PRR-associated RLKs on the activation of PTI signalling 
3. Understanding the contribution of PTI on plant immunity against adapted bacterial pathogens

The practical session “Surface Immunity” will consist of a pedagogical lecture on the biochemical and molecular biological techniques used to investigate the molecular basis of PTI signaling, and to identify novel PAMPs or PRRs. We will demonstrate some of the classical methods used to analyze downstream PTI responses, such as ROS production, MAPK activation, seedling growth inhibition and surface immunity upon spray infection with bacterial pathogens.

For measuring the PAMP-triggered ROS burst, we will make use of a luminescence-based assay, which enables the detection of apoplastic ROS that can be monitored live with a charge-coupled device camera. This is a fast and easy quantitative assay that can be used, in many cases, to study early PTI signalling in a given mutant compared to a wild type control.

In addition, we will assay for the induction of a MAPK cascade, specifically for the PAMP-induced phosphorylation of the four Arabidopsis MAPKs MPK3, MPK4, MPK6 and MPK11. Their activation can be detected within a few minutes after PAMP treatment by western blot analysis using a well-established commercial antibody that was raised to detect phosphorylated MAPKs in mammalian systems.
Prolonged exposure to PAMPs results in a growth arrest of seedlings, which can be used as a quantitative measure for the capability of a given genotype to respond to different stimuli. We will look at different Arabidopsis lines exposed to PAMPs for several days and assess the resulting growth differences compared to mock grown seedlings.

Finally, PAMP-triggered immunity contributes to the basal resistance of plants against adapted pathogens. In the frame of the practical session we will assess the differences in susceptibility of known PTI pathway mutants to demonstrate the importance of PTI for plant resistance.

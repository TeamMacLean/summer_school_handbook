# Application of Discovery and Targeted Proteomics in Plant Pathogen Interactions {-}

**Led by Frank Menke**

The field of proteomics is rapidly advancing, driven in part by technological innovation and the design of sophisticated approaches to target a specific biological question. Proteomics is a broad term that covers the large-scale analysis of proteins and their modifications (the proteome) in a given cell, tissue or organism under a defined condition. While this could involve a diverse set of approaches including molecular biology, biochemistry and genetics, in practise it mostly refers to protein purification and analysis by mass spectrometry [@Aebersold:2016kt].

Current developments in the proteomics field are very exciting and discovery (or shotgun) proteomics data sets are becoming more comprehensive with more sensitive hybrid mass spectrometers. Furthermore, targeted proteomics approaches, such as Selective Reaction Monitoring [@Picotti:2013jp] have made it possible to reproducible and accurately test a biological hypothesis (impossible with shotgun proteomics at the moment) and bring hands-on proteomics to biologists. 

This session will cover the basics of proteomics, including introduction to mass spectrometry and experimental design. We’ll look at both discovery and targeted proteomic workflows and how these can be used in studying plant pathogen interactions.

## Practical Session - Analysing and interpreting mass spec data  {-}

**Led by Frank Menke**

### Aims and Objectives {-}

1. Understanding how mass spec data analysed
2. learning how to interpret targeted proteomics data

Extracting raw data acquired by mass spectrometry to obtain an interpretable protein list is achieved by step-wise processing of the data files through a variety of purposely built open source and commercial software. The first tutorial will cover discovery proteomics and introduces basic concepts and frequently used data pipelines. Using actual data collected on TSL mass spectrometers, we will introduce the most important parameters and variables in data processing, and describe individual steps of the processing pipeline. We will create textual input for the search engine, and commence the search to interpret tandem mass spectra. This will result in a list of identified peptides, their sequences, and list of proteins. We will then interpret the results using several software that include web based search engine output, Scaffold, and data export to tabular format for further processing and visualization.

The second tutorial will cover targeted proteomics and analysis of Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) data in Skyline. In this elementary introduction to Skyline, students will build a spectral library, create a background proteome, import SRM data files and adjust settings to allow data refinement, analysis and interpretation.
